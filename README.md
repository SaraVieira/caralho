[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/SaraVieira/postcss-caralho/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/SaraVieira/postcss-caralho?branch=master)

[PostCSS] plugin for that changes curse words after ! to !important because why not ?

[PostCSS]: https://github.com/postcss/postcss

```css
.foo {
    top: 20px !fuck;
}
```

```css
.foo {
    top: 20px !important;
}
```

You can also choose from [many more](https://github.com/SaraVieira/curse-words) options in different languages and all of them will become `!important` after PostCSS does his/her thing.

## Why ?

Idk, mainly boredom and the need to write !caralho or !fuck in every stylesheet I own.

## I want to add words !

Awesome ! You can create a PR here:
[https://github.com/SaraVieira/curse-words](https://github.com/SaraVieira/curse-words) and these tests and the ones in [https://github.com/SaraVieira/babel-plugin-caralho](https://github.com/SaraVieira/babel-plugin-caralho) will be generated automatically ðŸŽ‰
